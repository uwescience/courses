<p>Martin worked hard to retain her seat, and was ultimately successful, holding Fannie Bay despite a heavy defeat for the ALP at the 1997 election. She subsequently served as Shadow Minister for Lands under then leader Maggie Hickey.

At the time, the Country Liberal Party had held office for the 27 years since self-government, and the Australian Labor Party had never come particularly close to government. However, the ALP was coming off a particularly successful eighteen months, and Martin ran a skilled campaign. She was also able to take advantage of a number of gaffes made by Chief Minister <a href="../../../../articles/d/e/n/Denis_Burke_%28Australian_politician%29_be0e.html" title="Denis Burke (Australian politician)">Denis Burke</a>, such as the decision to preference the <a href="../../../../articles/o/n/e/One_Nation_Party_46fb.html" class="mw-redirect" title="One Nation Party">One Nation Party</a> over the ALP - which lost the CLP a number of votes in crucial Darwin seats. Despite this, most commentators were predicting a close result with the CLP returned. However, in a shock result, the ALP achieved majority government by one seat, and Martin became the first ever ALP and first female Chief Minister in the history of the Northern Territory.</p>

<p>Although Martin appointed <a href="../../../../articles/i/n/d/Indigenous_Australians_67c9.html" title="Indigenous Australians">Aboriginal</a> Territorians to her cabinet, she has been criticised for not improving the lot of her Aboriginal constituents, the majority of whom have a life expectancy well below that of white Australians. A respected commentator in <i><a href="../../../../articles/t/h/e/The_Bulletin_f57c.html" title="The Bulletin">The Bulletin</a></i> has suggested that she has gone slow on Aboriginal issues because she fears a white backlash that could result in her government being toppled.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since July 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="../../../../articles/c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECitation_needed_0174.html" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup></p>
<p>The life expectancy of the Northern Territory's Aboriginal citizens has not increased markedly during Martin's administration.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since July 2007" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="../../../../articles/c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECitation_needed_0174.html" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup> Alcohol abuse continues to be a major issue in Aboriginal communities and third-world diseases like <a href="../../../../articles/t/r/a/Trachoma.html" title="Trachoma">trachoma</a> can be seen in remote Aboriginal townships. <sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup> However in 2006, Martin rejected accusations by <a href="../../../../articles/j/o/h/John_Howard_1ea1.html" title="John Howard">John Howard</a> and Federal Indigenous Affairs Minister, <a href="../../../../articles/m/a/l/Mal_Brough_b96f.html" title="Mal Brough">Mal Brough</a> that her government had been underfunding Aboriginal communities. <sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup>. A summit between the Federal and the Territorian Governments was proposed by Mal Brough in May 2006, but this, along with any potential to improve funding, was snubbed by Martin. <sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup></p>
<p>Martin has been critical of the Federal Government's intervention in Aboriginal communities as announced in 2007. She opposes certain aspects of the intervention such as removal of the permit system. In response, the Federal Government has rejected the Territory's argument, saying it is essential to remove artificial barriers to Aboriginal townships that prevent the measures needed to improve living conditions for Indigenous children <sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6" title="">[7]</a></sup></p>

<p>In the longer term, she oversaw the completion of the <a href="../../../../articles/t/h/e/The_Ghan_4bed.html" title="The Ghan">Adelaide-Darwin railway</a>, which had begun under the Burke government, and vowed to resurrect the stalled statehood movement. <sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7" title="">[8]</a></sup> She also managed to markedly boost the ALP's standing amongst the electorate, as seen in the 2003 Katherine by-election, which saw a major swing to the party.</p>
<p>By 2005, the Northern Territory, under Martin's leadership, had achieved the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>the highest economic growth in Australia at 7.2 per cent</li>
<li>the lowest small business taxes</li>
<li>record population growth</li>
<li>the highest building approval rates</li>
<li>surging house prices and record levels of home ownership.</li>
<li>Property crime almost halved</li>
<li>Approval for $1 billion development of Darwin wharf precinct<sup id="cite_ref-smh_2-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-smh-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>As Chief Minister, Martin led the ALP to the <a href="../../../../articles/n/o/r/Northern_Territory_legislative_election%2C_2005_ace8.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Northern Territory legislative election, 2005">2005 election</a>, which was their first as an incumbent government in the Territory. Martin campaigned largely on law and order issues. It was predicted that the ALP would win a relatively narrow victory. The final result gave 19 seats to the ALP, 4 to the opposition CLP and 2 to independents. The ALP won 6 new seats, including unseating the <a href="../../../../articles/o/p/p/Opposition_Leader_of_the_Northern_Territory_55cd.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Opposition Leader of the Northern Territory">Opposition Leader</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/d/e/n/Denis_Burke_%28Australian_politician%29_be0e.html" title="Denis Burke (Australian politician)">Denis Burke</a>, in the most unexpected victory of all.</p>
