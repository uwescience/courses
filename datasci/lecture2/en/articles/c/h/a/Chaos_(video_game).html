<p><i>Chaos</i> was written by Julian Gollop, based on his designs for a traditional card game. The Chaos card game was in turn inspired by the early <a href="../../../../articles/g/a/m/Games_Workshop_bae0.html" title="Games Workshop">Games Workshop</a> board game <i>Warlock</i>. He was an avid card game designer but then saw computers as a way of hiding game rules too complicated for pen-and-paper scenarios. Thus the board used in the card game became the tiled map in the video game.<sup id="cite_ref-edge_0-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-edge-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>

<p>In <i>Chaos</i>, players take the role of <a href="../../../../articles/w/i/z/Wizard_%28fantasy%29.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Wizard (fantasy)">wizards</a> who vie with one another to win the game. The aim of the game is to be the 'last wizard standing' by destroying all other wizards. The game allows for anything between two and eight wizards, any of whom can be human or computer controlled. The level of the computer controlled wizards must be selected, ranging from 1 to 8. Higher levels improve the computer wizards' combat statistics, but does not improve their <a href="../../../../articles/a/r/t/Artificial_intelligence.html" title="Artificial intelligence">artificial intelligence</a>. Computer controlled wizards do not cooperate; they will attempt to kill each other as well as the human players.</p>
<p><i>Chaos</i> is a turn-based game. Each turn, every player in order selects and casts a spell, then moves their wizard and any summoned creatures.</p>

<p>Each wizard is given a random selection of spells at the start of the game with which to defeat the other wizards. Spells are either Lawful, Neutral, or Chaotic, and have a difficulty value expressed as a percentage chance of success when cast. A spell can only be cast once, with the exception of the "Disbelieve" spell which is always available to every wizard. New spells can only be acquired via the "Magic Wood" spell.</p>
<p>During the game, the type of spells cast affects the subsequent difficulty of other spells. Casting many lawful spells results in a more lawful environment, which in turn makes other lawful spells easier to cast. The same principle applies to chaotic spells. Spells of the opposite alignment are not more difficult to cast however. Neutral spells are unaffected either way, and are always cast at the same difficulty percentage. This feature has a big impact on the strategy of the game, as a viable tactic is to cast lots of easy spells of a certain alignment, in order to make it easier to cast the more powerful spells of that alignment.</p>
<p>Spells fall into various categories and have various ranges.</p>
<p><a name="Creature_spells" id="Creature_spells"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../../articles/c/h/a/Chaos_%28video_game%29.html" title="Edit section: Creature spells">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Creature spells</span></h4>
<p>These summon creatures that fight for the wizards. Some creatures are harder to cast than others, generally speaking the more powerful the creature the harder it is to cast. Creatures can be cast as an "Illusion", with a 100% chance of being cast, with the disadvantage that they can be destroyed if another wizard casts a "Disbelieve" spell at them. Creature spells always have a range of one, this is to prevent a wizard casting a powerful creature right next to another wizard and killing him easily. Creatures can fall into one or more of several categories:</p>
<ol>
<li><i>Undead</i> creatures, such as Ghosts, Spectres and Zombies can only be attacked by other undead creatures or by spells and magic weapons. Dead creatures that have been raised with the "Raise Dead" spell also become Undead.</li>
<li><i>Flying</i> creatures, such as Bats, Dragons and Manticores.</li>
<li><i>Rideable</i> creatures such as Centaurs, Horses and Unicorns, can be ridden by wizards. Flying mounts such as the Pegusus and Gryphon are also available. Any attack against the wizard/mount combination is directed at the mount, which must be killed before the wizard can be affected, increasing the wizards survivability. A particularly powerful mount is a rideable creature that has been raised from the dead, effectively making the wizard undead also.</li>
<li><i>Armed</i> creatures, such as Centaurs, Dragons and Elves. Centaurs and Elves are armed with bows, dragons with fire, and can launch an attack on a target several squares away at the end of their turn.</li>
</ol>
<p>Creatures have attack and defense ratings which govern how effective they are, move ratings which control how many squares they can move a turn, manouvre ratings which govern how easily a creature can break off combat and magic resistance for governing defence against magical assaults. Flying creatures movement ratings govern how many square they can fly. Wizards also have these ratings, as well as a magic rating governing how many spells they initially have.</p>

<p>Object spells create objects on the board. They are&#160;:-</p>
<ol>
<li><i>Magic Wood</i>. Automatically creates up to 8 trees around a wizard. Any wizard can enter a tree and will receive a new spell after a random number of turns. Magic trees also provide a certain amount of protection.</li>
<li><i>Shadow Wood</i>. Allows a player to place up to 8 trees up to 8 squares away, as long as they are not adjacent to each other. Shadow Trees are treated as creatures, however they cannot move. They can attack anything that moves next to them, although they cannot harm undead creatures.</li>
<li><i>Gooey Blob</i> and <i>Magic Fire</i> spread randomly once cast. Any creature engulfed by one of these objects is trapped (Gooey Blob) or destroyed (Magic Fire). A wizard engulfed by a Gooey Blob is killed. Gooey Blobs can be destroyed by attacks, though fire cannot. If a Gooey Blob disappears or is destroyed the creature can move again. If cast early enough, these spells can be very powerful as they spread across the board. In the original Spectrum version they do not trap/destroy your own creatures or wizard.</li>
<li><i>Wall</i> creates four 'blocks' of wall. They can be flown over and cannot be cast directly adjacent to the casting wizard - this is to prevent a wizard walling himself into a corner, making him immune to all non-flying attacks. However, enemy wizards can be trapped in this way.</li>
<li><i>Dark Citadels</i> and <i>Magic Castles</i> last for a random number of turns. When a wizard is inside one of these buildings they cannot be attacked.</li>
</ol>

<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../../articles/c/h/a/Chaos_%28video_game%29.html" title="Edit section: Attacking spells">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Attacking spells</span></h4>
<ol>
<li><i>Magic Bolts</i> and <i>Lightning</i> can be used to attack other creatures (including undead creatures) and wizards. Lightning is more effective but has a shorter range.</li>
<li><i>Vengeance</i> and <i>Decree</i> allow one attack on an enemy creature or wizard and <i>Dark Power</i> and <i>Justice</i> allow up to three attacks. They are less effective on creatures with stronger magic resistance. A successful attack on a creature destroys it, a successful attack on a wizard causes <i>all</i> of their summoned creations to vanish, though the wizard is not destroyed.</li>
</ol>

<p>These directly affect the wizard who casts them and can be used to increase effectiveness.</p>
<ol>
<li><i>Magic Armour</i> and <i>Magic Shield</i> provide increased defense by 4 and 2 respectively from attacks, including spells.</li>
<li><i>Magic Sword</i> and <i>Magic Knife</i> give increased combat ratings by 4 and 2 respectively. They also allow attacks against undead creatures.</li>
<li><i>Magic Bow</i> gives a wizard ranged combat with attack 2, range 6, including against undead creatures. It also allows hand to hand attacks against undead.</li>
<li><i>Magic Wings</i> allow the wizard to fly.</li>
<li><i>Shadow Form</i> increases the wizards movement to 3, increases defense by 1, and means that the wizard can move past enemy creatures without becoming 'engaged to enemy'. Shadow Form ends if the wizard attacks in hand to hand combat.</li>
</ol>
<p><a name="Miscellaneous_spells" id="Miscellaneous_spells"></a></p>
<h4><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../../articles/c/h/a/Chaos_%28video_game%29.html" title="Edit section: Miscellaneous spells">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Miscellaneous spells</span></h4>
<ol>
<li><i>Law</i> and <i>Chaos</i> spells increase the law or chaos level in the game. They come in various levels, increasing the level by either one or two points.</li>
<li><i>Raise Dead</i> allows a dead creature to be reanimated under the wizards control. The raised creature retains all the powers and abilities it had in life, and in addition is now also undead.</li>
<li><i>Subversion</i> attempts to steal another wizard's creature, but will always fail against a creature which is an illusion.</li>
<li><i>Disbelieve</i> can be used against illusionary creatures to destroy them. This spell does not disappear after use and is always in a wizards spellbook</li>
<li><i>Turmoil</i> is a very rare spell only obtainable from a Magic Wood. This causes all objects and creatures on the screen to be moved to a random location. This can cause the game to crash if there are a large number of objects on the screen, such as Magic Fires or Gooey Blobs.</li>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../../articles/c/h/a/Chaos_%28video_game%29.html" title="Edit section: Turn Sequence">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Turn Sequence</span></h3>
<div class="floatright"><span><a href="../../../../articles/c/h/a/Image%7EChaosAni.gif_3891.html" class="image" title="A game of Chaos in progress"><img alt="A game of Chaos in progress" src="../../../../images/shared/b/b4/ChaosAni.gif" width="320" height="200" border="0" /></a></span></div>
<p>Each (human) wizard takes it in turn to view the board (if desired), examine their spells and select one to cast on the next turn (selecting a spell is not compulsory). Typically, the other human players look away during spell choice to avoid unfair advantage. Once all players have chosen their spell, they attempt to cast them in order.</p>
<p>Whereas the human players select their spells before each turn begins, the computer wizards actually select their spells during the play stage of each turn. This is not documented, although it becomes apparent in play, as the computer wizards often cast spells that would have required foreknowledge of the other players' actions. For example, a computer wizard might cast a 'disbelieve' spell immediately after a human player has conjured a powerful creature, or the computer might fire a 'Magic Bolt' at a player-summoned creature when no targets were in range beforehand.</p>
<p>Once all spells have been cast, surviving wizards take it in turns to move themselves and any creatures under their control (unless they are 'engaged'), and attack other wizards/creatures.</p>
<p><a name="Combat" id="Combat"></a></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../../articles/c/h/a/Chaos_%28video_game%29.html" title="Edit section: Combat">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Combat</span></h3>
<p>Other creatures or wizards are attacked by either moving into them, or flying onto them. Moving or flying next to an enemy creature automatically 'engages' them, and allows for an immediate attack. If an attack is successful the enemy creature disappears/dies and the attacking creature moves onto its square. Flying onto a creature allows an attack, but the flying creature remains in place unless it succeeds in killing its target, in which case it takes its place as above. Only defending creatures can be killed, attacking creatures are safe until attacked themselves.</p>
<p>Success depends on the attacking creature's combat rating vs. the defending creature's defense rating and a certain amount of randomness. Some creatures have ranged combat, allowing them to attack other creatures from afar, so long as there is a clear line of sight. An undead creature can only be attacked by other undead creatures (or magic weapon equipped wizards), but can attack both undead and non-undead creatures itself.</p>
<p>Any creature equipped with ranged weapons automatically has a chance to use them after movement and/or combat. They can fire at any creature in range (even allied ones, or their own wizard!) with no risk to themselves.</p>
<p>Once all wizards have taken it in turn to move and fight, the turn sequence starts over from the beginning. For human players, no actions are compulsory, they may simply skip any actions they do not want to take. Computer controlled wizards will ALWAYS move, unless in a Magic Wood / Castle / Citadel, even when it is not in their best interest to do so. Likewise all computer controlled creatures ALWAYS attempt to move each turn.</p>
<p>If a wizard is destroyed, all his creations immediately vanish also.</p>

<p><i><a href="../../../../articles/c/r/a/CRASH_%28magazine%29_d1f7.html" title="CRASH (magazine)">CRASH</a></i> awarded <i>Chaos</i> 8 out of 10 in issue 16<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup>, praising neatness of presentation, efficient sound effects, pleasing sprites and concluding that it was a very good multiplayer strategy game. Criticisms included the sparseness of the initial playing area, lack of status report for the wizards and information on how much damage was being dealt.
