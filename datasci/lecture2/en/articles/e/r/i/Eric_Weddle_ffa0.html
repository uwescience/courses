<p>Upon enrolling at the <a href="../../../../articles/u/n/i/University_of_Utah_bbd8.html" title="University of Utah">University of Utah</a> in 2003, Weddle was immediately put into action, starting his last nine games at right <a href="../../../../articles/c/o/r/Cornerback.html" title="Cornerback">cornerback</a>.

<p>Nearing the end of an electrifying senior year, Doug Robinson of the <i><a href="../../../../articles/d/e/s/Deseret_Morning_News_f677.html" title="Deseret Morning News">Deseret Morning News</a></i> wrote an article championing Weddle for the <a href="../../../../articles/h/e/i/Heisman_Trophy_cdcb.html" title="Heisman Trophy">Heisman Trophy</a> based on how valuable he is to the Utah Utes. He wrote, "The only people who spend more time on the field than Weddle each Saturday are referees. Against <a href="../../../../articles/u/n/i/United_States_Air_Force_Academy_ee12.html" title="United States Air Force Academy">Air Force</a> two weeks ago, Weddle played every snap on defense and collected eight tackles.

Despite the price San Diego ended up paying for Weddle, experts still believed he would be of tremendous value to the Chargers.</p>
<p>In a short article by the <i><a href="../../../../articles/u/n/i/Union_Tribune_40ec.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Union Tribune">Union Tribune</a></i> 's Jay Posner, he quoted <a href="../../../../articles/n/f/l/NFL_Network_7ae3.html" title="NFL Network">NFL Network</a> draft analyst <a href="../../../../articles/m/i/k/Mike_Mayock_36dc.html" title="Mike Mayock">Mike Mayock</a> as saying, "He will upgrade them athletically in the middle of the field.

<p>In a feature article by <a href="../../../../articles/c/b/s/CBS_SportsLine.com_9083.html" class="mw-redirect" title="CBS SportsLine.com">CBS SportsLine.com</a>'s Clark Judge, Judge praised Weddle as "the most intriguing safety in the draft." because of his versatility and ability to play so many positions. He quoted Weddle with, "I'm just a guy who loves football and will do anything for the team. I'll go out there and play special teams like I've done in my career. I'll play offense or defense or whatever the teams needs. And I'll do the best I can."</p>
<p>Judge highlighted how Weddle was able to shut down the <a href="../../../../articles/g/e/o/Georgia_Tech_Yellow_Jackets_football_992e.html" title="Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football">Georgia Tech football team</a>'s <a href="../../../../articles/c/a/l/Calvin_Johnson_%28American_football%29_a107.html" title="Calvin Johnson (American football)">Calvin Johnson</a>, holding him to 2 catches for 19 yards in the 2005 Emerald Bowl. Judge wrote, "Johnson is the best player in the draft, but Weddle was the Defensive MVP of that game." When asked by Judge how he did it, Weddle responded, "I pride myself on preparation. I had four weeks to prepare for a player of (Johnson's) caliber. You have to bring your A-plus game. If you film-study you can eliminate stuff ... you can eliminate 90 percent of what the guy's going to do just based by his split, his release. So half the game I knew what he was going to do before he did it, and I was just breaking on the routes. No disrespect to their team, but the times they threw to him I was just breaking on the ball."<sup id="cite_ref-jud_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-jud-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>When asked by Judge how he expects to help an NFL team, Weddle responded, "The million dollar question is what I like better -- corner or safety. I think (NFL teams) get irritated because I say, 'both of them.' They want to hear an answer, but that's true. I love playing man-to-man. I love playing outside, the challenge it brings. I love blitzing. I love playing zones or being around the box. Whatever the team needs."<sup id="cite_ref-jud_2-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-jud-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
<p>In an interview with Colin Cowherd on ESPN Radio's <a href="../../../../articles/t/h/e/The_Herd_with_Colin_Cowherd_6477.html" title="The Herd with Colin Cowherd">The Herd with Colin Cowherd</a>, former Titans GM <a href="../../../../articles/f/l/o/Floyd_Reese_f617.html" title="Floyd Reese">Floyd Reese</a> was asked about this pick and how much the Chargers had given up to get him and intimated to Colin that he believes Weddle to be the best athlete of the 2007 Draft.</p>
<p>In an interview with Chargers.com after the draft, <a href="../../../../articles/b/u/d/Buddy_Nix_8328.html" title="Buddy Nix">Buddy Nix</a> and new head coach <a href="../../../../articles/n/o/r/Norv_Turner_4ec4.html" title="Norv Turner">Norv Turner</a> were asked about their opinion of Weddle. When asked what he liked about him most, Nix responded, "I think his versatility is one thing. Our defense, instead of having to substitute and guess when you start getting full of wide-outs and that kind of thing, this guy can walk up and play the slot man which is hard to do without having to substitute, like on third down when we would play nickel or dime. But if they throw it out there at you and don’t have somebody that can go down and play on the slot, then it causes you problems."</p>
<p>Turner also had this to say about Weddle: "First of all Eric is a guy makes a strong impression on you right away. He’s a confident guy. He’s an outgoing guy. I think the fact that this guy can line-up and play safety, play on the slot and he’s played outside and corner at Utah. They showed one of the clips and we caught some of it but they showed one of him lined-up at quarterback on third down and taking a shotgun snap and running with the ball. He’s a highly intelligent player and he has a knack. Some guys have it and some guys don’t. There were a couple plays that we were looking at and Ted Cottrell (defensive coordinator) called me in one day and said ‘look at this play’ and he tackles the guy from behind, spins him and when they both bounce off the ground Eric has the ball in his hand and he never touches the ground, he picks it up and runs it in for a touchdown. As Buddy said, he had four returns for touchdowns. He’s a guy that finds a way to make plays. He gives us versatility in the secondary, and obviously gives us a guy that will be a playmaker on special teams. Our defensive coaches were really excited when we walked down the hall and said we’re going to get this player." He really is a soon to be Brian Dawkins or Ed Reed<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

<p>As of September 1st 2007, after all the necessary cuts to reduce the roster to 53 players, Weddle is the strong safety behind <a href="../../../../articles/c/l/i/Clinton_Hart_4560.html" title="Clinton Hart">Clinton Hart</a>. He is also known to be the teams <a href="../../../../articles/d/i/m/Dimeback.html" title="Dimeback">Dimeback</a> playing in 2nd/3rd and long situations, along with being the backup holder on special teams. It has been speculated that he would be used instead of the current holder Mike Scifres in situations where a fake field goal or extra point attempt would occur as he is a threat to run or throw the ball in those situations.</p>
<p>Weddle caught his first NFL regular season interception on October 28, 2007 against the <a href="../../../../articles/h/o/u/Houston_Texans_c5f6.html" title="Houston Texans">Houston Texans</a> in <a href="../../../../articles/q/u/a/Qualcomm_Stadium_e9cc.html" title="Qualcomm Stadium">Qualcomm Stadium</a>.</p>
<p><br />
On the Current Chargers roster, he is the projected starter at Free Safety, barring any setbacks.</p>
