<p>Lloyd was injured his first year (<a href="../../../../articles/1/9/8/1987_NFL_season_e726.html" title="1987 NFL season">1987</a>), and most of the <a href="../../../../articles/1/9/8/1988_NFL_season_a292.html" title="1988 NFL season">1988</a> season, but became a starter during the <a href="../../../../articles/1/9/8/1989_NFL_season_3d26.html" title="1989 NFL season">1989</a> season at outside <a href="../../../../articles/l/i/n/Linebacker.html" title="Linebacker">linebacker</a> where he excelled.

He was named to five <a href="../../../../articles/p/r/o/Pro_Bowl_580f.html" title="Pro Bowl">Pro Bowls</a> and 3 NFL All-Pro teams during this time, and was widely recognized as the top all-around outside linebacker during the 1990s.

<p>Lloyd never got along with the media; he was impatient and intolerant with them. This, along with his career-ending injuries, led many to believe that he lost votes for the NFL 1990s Team of the Decade selection in which other Steelers linebackers like <a href="../../../../articles/l/e/v/Levon_Kirkland_92bc.html" title="Levon Kirkland">Levon Kirkland</a> and <a href="../../../../articles/k/e/v/Kevin_Greene_12b3.html" title="Kevin Greene">Kevin Greene</a> were selected even though Lloyd was always considered the top linebacker and defensive leader of the team.</p>
<p>In 1991, <a href="../../../../articles/j/o/e/Joe_Namath_dedd.html" title="Joe Namath">Joe Namath</a> then an analyst of NBC accused Lloyd of playing dirty, Lloyd resonded by saying "Who is Joe Namath? This is a guy who, if he played in the league today, I'd probably just go hit him late and see what he did, just for the hell of it. Joe Namath can go to hell; he can kiss my ass."</p>
<p>In January 1996, following their victory over the Indianapolis Colts in the 1995 AFC championship game. NBC reporter Jim Gray interviewed Lloyd and he gathered attention of the rest of the team and said "Let's see if we bring this damn trophy here next year along with the fuckin Super Bowl."</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Lloyd was voted by Steeler fans to the prestigious Pittsburgh Steeler 75th Anniversary Team -- a team that included only 5 linebackers and put him next to the company of dynasty players like Jack Ham and Jack Lambert. Thus, while he may not have been popular with the press, the fans who saw him play recognized his place in Steeler lore. Indeed, the Steeler fans and front office considered Lloyd a throwback player. Lloyd's number 95 jersey was one of the top-selling jerseys among Steeler fans. It was either Steelers President <a href="../../../../articles/d/a/n/Dan_Rooney_7ec5.html" title="Dan Rooney">Dan Rooney</a> or Director of Operations <a href="../../../../articles/t/o/m/Tom_Donahoe_9b84.html" title="Tom Donahoe">Tom Donahoe</a> who once said of Greg Lloyd, "He was one of the Best, not just one of the Steelers' best but one of the best in the league. Greg could play in any era. He has the makeup, whether it's in 1998 or 1938. He's just a football player."</p>
<p>Lloyd's number 95 remains in circulation with the Steelers despite his accomplishments, although no significant Steeler of note has worn it in a regular season game since his playing days ended. Lloyd remains so respected by fans in Steeler nation that <a href="../../../../articles/j/o/e/Joey_Porter_0ff0.html" title="Joey Porter">Joey Porter</a> felt the need to acknowledge Lloyd's enduring presence when the team drafted him in <a href="../../../../articles/1/9/9/1999_NFL_draft_6c04.html" class="mw-redirect" title="1999 NFL draft">1999</a> and issued him number 95 in training camp, the first time since Lloyd left that the team assigned the number. However, although his playing style and team leadership were comparable to Lloyd's, Porter switched to his more familiar number 55 by the time the regular season started, stating that he wanted to establish his own identity with the team as opposed to being a clone of Lloyd. Ironically, after Porter was cut by the Steelers and signed by the <a href="../../../../articles/m/i/a/Miami_Dolphins_fba7.html" title="Miami Dolphins">Miami Dolphins</a> in the 2007 offseason, rookie linebacker <a href="../../../../articles/l/a/m/LaMarr_Woodley_6833.html" title="LaMarr Woodley">LaMarr Woodley</a> would be issued Porter's number 55 but would switch to number 56 just before the start of the regular season after <a href="../../../../articles/c/e/n/Center_%28American_football%29_d754.html" title="Center (American football)">center</a> <a href="../../../../articles/c/h/u/Chukky_Okobi_c8fe.html" title="Chukky Okobi">Chukky Okobi</a> was released on the final cutdown.</p>
<p>Lloyd was notorious for wearing a ratty, old t-shirt at practice and under his game jersey which read, "I Wasn't Hired For My Disposition."</p>
<p>As Steeler fans recognized by voting him to their 75th anniversary team, Lloyd was indeed the most feared player in the league for his time. <a href="../../../../articles/j/i/m/Jim_Harbaugh_e2b7.html" title="Jim Harbaugh">Jim Harbaugh</a> claims he wasn't afraid of anything until he played against Greg Lloyd, the man he respected and feared on the gridiron more than anyone.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../../articles/g/r/e/Greg_Lloyd_5b29.html" title="Edit section: Legal trouble">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Legal trouble</span></h2>
<p>In <a href="../../../../articles/2/0/0/2003.html" title="2003">2003</a>, Lloyd was charged with aggravated assault after he supposedly shoved a pistol in his son's mouth for poor grades in a <a href="../../../../articles/2/0/0/2001.html" title="2001">2001</a> incident. The trial resulted in a mistrial in <a href="../../../../articles/2/0/0/2004.html" title="2004">2004</a>. Lloyd is also going through a divorce with his wife, Rhonda. In January 2003, Lloyd was charged with simple assault after pointing a gun at his wife's head. He pleaded <a href="../../../../articles/n/o/l/Nolo_contendere.html" title="Nolo contendere">no contest</a> and received probation. In June 2003, Lloyd was charged with aggravated stalking for taking a package that belonged to his estranged wife from a Mail Boxes, Etc. store. The case is still pending.</p>
