<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../../articles/p/l/a/Plastic_recycling.html" title="Edit section: Processing">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Processing</span></h2>
<p>When compared to other materials like <a href="../../../../articles/g/l/a/Glass.html" title="Glass">glass</a> and <a href="../../../../articles/m/e/t/Metal.html" title="Metal">metal</a> materials, plastic polymers require greater processing to be recycled.<sup class="noprint Template-Fact"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources&#160;since May 2008" style="white-space: nowrap;">[<i><a href="../../../../articles/c/i/t/Wikipedia%7ECitation_needed_0174.html" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</span></sup> Plastics have a low <a href="../../../../articles/e/n/t/Entropy.html" title="Entropy">entropy</a> of mixing, which is due to the high <a href="../../../../articles/m/o/l/Molecular_weight.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Molecular weight">molecular weight</a> of their large polymer chains. A <a href="../../../../articles/m/a/c/Macromolecule.html" title="Macromolecule">macromolecule</a> interacts with its environment along its entire length, so its <a href="../../../../articles/e/n/t/Enthalpy.html" title="Enthalpy">enthalpy</a> of mixing is large compared to that of an <a href="../../../../articles/o/r/g/Organic.html" title="Organic">organic</a> molecule with a similar structure. Heating alone is not enough to dissolve such a large molecule; because of this, plastics must often be of nearly identical composition in order to mix efficiently.</p>
<p>When different types of plastics are melted together they tend to <a href="../../../../articles/p/h/a/Phase_separation.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Phase separation">phase-separate</a>, like oil and water, and set in these layers. The phase boundaries cause structural weakness in the resulting material, meaning that <a href="../../../../articles/p/o/l/Polymer_blend.html" title="Polymer blend">polymer blends</a> are only useful in limited applications.</p>
<p>Another barrier to recycling is the widespread use of <a href="../../../../articles/d/y/e/Dyes.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Dyes">dyes</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/f/i/l/Fillers.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Fillers">fillers</a>, and other additives in plastics. The polymer is generally too <a href="../../../../articles/v/i/s/Viscosity.html" title="Viscosity">viscous</a> to economically remove fillers, and would be damaged by many of the processes that could cheaply remove the added dyes. Additives are less widely used in beverage containers and <a href="../../../../articles/p/l/a/Plastic_bag.html" title="Plastic bag">plastic bags</a>, allowing them to be recycled more frequently.</p>
<p>The use of <a href="../../../../articles/b/i/o/Biodegradable_plastic.html" title="Biodegradable plastic">biodegradable plastics</a> is increasing. If some of these get mixed in the other plastics for recycling, the recycled plastic is less valuable.</p>
<p>Many such problems can be solved by using a more elaborate <i><a href="../../../../articles/m/o/n/Monomer.html" title="Monomer">monomer</a> recycling</i> process, in which a <a href="../../../../articles/c/o/n/Condensation_polymer.html" title="Condensation polymer">condensation polymer</a> essentially undergoes the inverse of the <a href="../../../../articles/p/o/l/Polymerization.html" title="Polymerization">polymerization</a> reaction used to manufacture it. This yields the same mix of chemicals that formed the original polymer, which can be purified and used to synthesize new polymer chains of the same type. <a href="../../../../articles/d/u/_/Du_Pont_bb71.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Du Pont">Du Pont</a> opened a pilot plant of this type in <a href="../../../../articles/c/a/p/Cape_Fear%2C_North_Carolina_e5bc.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Cape Fear, North Carolina">Cape Fear, North Carolina</a>, to recycle PET by a process of <a href="../../../../articles/t/r/a/Transesterification.html" title="Transesterification">methanolysis</a>, but it closed the plant due to economic pressures.</p>
<p>Another potential option is the conversion of assorted polymers into <a href="../../../../articles/p/e/t/Petroleum.html" title="Petroleum">petroleum</a> by a much less precise <a href="../../../../articles/t/h/e/Thermal_depolymerization.html" title="Thermal depolymerization">thermal depolymerization</a> process. Such a process would be able to accept almost any polymer or mix of polymers, including <a href="../../../../articles/t/h/e/Thermoset.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Thermoset">thermoset</a> materials such as vulcanized <a href="../../../../articles/r/u/b/Rubber.html" title="Rubber">rubber</a> <a href="../../../../articles/t/i/r/Tire.html" title="Tire">tires</a> and the biopolymers in <a href="../../../../articles/f/e/a/Feather.html" title="Feather">feathers</a> and other agricultural waste. Like natural petroleum, the chemicals produced can be made into fuels as well as polymers. A pilot plant of this type exists in <a href="../../../../articles/c/a/r/Carthage%2C_Missouri_8439.html" title="Carthage, Missouri">Carthage, Missouri</a>, using turkey waste as input material. <i>See the main article on <a href="../../../../articles/t/h/e/Thermal_depolymerization.html" title="Thermal depolymerization">thermal depolymerization</a>.</i> <a href="../../../../articles/g/a/s/Gasification.html" title="Gasification">Gasification</a> is a similar process, but is not technically recycling since polymers are not likely to become the result.</p>
<p>Recently, a process has also been developed in which many kinds of plastic can be used as a <a href="../../../../articles/c/a/r/Carbon.html" title="Carbon">carbon</a> source in the recycling of scrap <a href="../../../../articles/s/t/e/Steel.html" title="Steel">steel</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>Yet another process that is gaining ground with startup companies (especially in <a href="../../../../articles/a/u/s/Australia.html" title="Australia">Australia</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/u/n/i/United_States_09d4.html" title="United States">United States</a> and <a href="../../../../articles/j/a/p/Japan.html" title="Japan">Japan</a>) is Heat Compression. The heat compression process takes all unsorted, cleaned plastic in all forms, from soft plastic bags to hard industrial waste, and mixes the load in <a href="../../../../articles/t/u/m/Tumblers.html" title="Tumblers">tumblers</a> (large rotating drums resembling giant <a href="../../../../articles/c/l/o/Clothes_dryer.html" title="Clothes dryer">clothes dryers</a>). The most obvious benefit to this method is the fact that all plastic is recyclable, not just matching forms. But criticism rises from the energy costs of rotating the drums, and heating the post-melt pipes.</p>

<p>CNN reports that Indian Dr. S. Madhu of the Kerala Highway Research Institute has formulated a road surface that includes recycled plastic. Aggregate, bitumen (asphalt) with plastic that has been shredded and melted at a temperature below 220 degrees C to avoid pollution. This road surface is claimed to be very durable and monsoon rain resistant. The plastic is sorted by hand, which is economical in India. The test road used 60 kg of plastic for an approx. 500m long, 8m wide, two-lane road. One kilometer of one-lane road would need 60 kg of old plastic. Since the US annually uses 100 million metric tons of plastic, it could pave 1 2/3 billion km of single-lane road this way.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../../articles/p/l/a/Plastic_recycling.html" title="Edit section: Consumers">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Consumers</span></h2>
<p>Plastic recycling rates lag far behind those of other items, such as newspaper (about 80%) and cardboard (about 70%). One reason is that consumers often don’t understand the types of plastics that can be recycled in their area. Types of plastics are assigned a number, called a <a href="../../../../articles/r/e/s/Resin_identification_code.html" title="Resin identification code">resin identification code</a>, which is usually stamped or printed on the bottom of containers and surrounded by a <a href="../../../../articles/r/e/c/Recycling_symbol.html" title="Recycling symbol">recycling symbol</a> (a triangle of arrows). (See the table in <a href="../../../../articles/p/l/a/Plastic.html" title="Plastic">Plastic</a>.) Numbers 1, 2, and 6 are the most-often recycled plastics in the United States. Many municipal recycling programs exist in the United States.</p>
<p>Consumers can find out which plastics are accepted in their local area and how to recycle, prepare and transfer them by contacting their local recycling hauler (usually the local city or county solid waste or public works department, or a private company). Generally, paper labels do not need to be removed from plastic bottles or containers, but lids should be thrown away because they typically are made from a type of plastic that is not recyclable. Plastic bottles and containers must be rinsed, squashed, and placed in recycle bins for collection. Plastic grocery bags are often accepted by stores in recycling containers placed near the entranceways. <sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4" title="">[5]</a></sup></p>

<p>In the UK, the amount of post-consumer plastic being recycled is relatively low<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5" title="">[6]</a></sup>, due in part to a lack of recycling facilities. Only a few exist in the whole country and many people do not know what plastics can be recycled. Furthermore, most of the plastic that is re-used is sent to China to be recycled, raising ethical questions as well as concern that such recycling costs more CO2 emissions than simply burying in landfill. Others will counterclaim that many recycling programs exist in the UK, and landfill is not an option if there are no sites to fill. One of the largest recyclers of PET bottles is based there and also has initiated one of the first "bottle to bottle" recycling businesses in the world. Many other 'waste' products are sent to China for recycling, using the often empty containers that are used for delivering goods to the UK and that are sent back for re-use.</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../../../articles/p/l/a/Plastic_recycling.html" title="Edit section: Plastic Identification Code">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline">Plastic Identification Code</span></h2>
<p>Seven groups of plastic polymers,<sup id="cite_ref-singapore_6-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-singapore-6" title="">[7]</a></sup> each with specific properties, are used worldwide for packaging applications (see table below). Each group of plastic polymer can be identified by its Plastic Identification code (PIC) - usually a number or a letter abbreviation. For instance, Low-Density Polyethylene can be identified by the number "4" and/or the letters "LDPE". The PIC appears inside a three-chasing arrow recycling symbol. The symbol is used to indicate whether the plastic can be recycled into new products.</p>
<p>The PIC was introduced by the Society of the Plastics Industry, Inc. which provides a uniform system for the identification of different polymer types and helps recycling companies to separate different plastics for reprocessing. Manufacturers of plastic food packaging and containers can voluntarily mark their products with the PIC. Consumers can identify the plastic types based on the codes usually found at the base or at the side of the plastic food packaging and containers. The PIC is usually not present on packaging films, as it is not practical to collect and recycle most of this type of waste.</p>
