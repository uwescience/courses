<p><i><b>Jimbo and the Jet Set</b></i> (often shortened to simply <i><b>Jimbo</b></i>) was a <a href="../../../../articles/u/k/_/Uk.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Uk">British</a> <a href="../../../../articles/a/n/i/Animation.html" title="Animation">animated</a> cartoon series in the <a href="../../../../articles/1/9/8/1980s.html" title="1980s">1980s</a>, featuring the adventures of the eponymous Jimbo, a talking <a href="../../../../articles/a/e/r/Aeroplane.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Aeroplane">aeroplane</a>. Created by Maddocks Cartoon Productions, it originally ran for 25 episodes between <a href="../../../../articles/1/9/8/1985.html" title="1985">1985</a> and <a href="../../../../articles/1/9/8/1986.html" title="1986">1986</a>.</p>
<p>The proviso to the cartoon is that Jimbo was originally intended to be a <a href="../../../../articles/b/o/e/Boeing_747.html" title="Boeing 747">Jumbo Jet</a>, but his designer couldn't tell the difference between <a href="../../../../articles/i/n/c/Inch.html" title="Inch">inches</a> and <a href="../../../../articles/c/e/n/Centimetre.html" title="Centimetre">centimetres</a>, resulting in his diminutive size.</p>
<p>The television series featured various talking airport-type ground vehicles (Tommy Tow-Truck, Claude Catering, Amanda Baggage, Phil the Fuel Truck, Sammy Steps, etc), and Harry Helicopter. Other plane characters appear from time to time, such as Old Timer, a <a href="../../../../articles/v/i/c/Vickers_Wellington_ecbd.html" title="Vickers Wellington">Vickers Wellington</a> bomber who gets into the story while flying to or from an <a href="../../../../articles/a/i/r/Airshow.html" title="Airshow">airshow</a>. The story is based at a fictional "London Airport", under the command of an irate controller who frequently ends episodes screaming "I want words with you, Jimbo!".</p>
<p>Some printed material and toy merchandise featured Gloria Gatwick, a female counterpart to Jimbo, but she did not appear in a speaking role within the TV episodes (save for one brief appearance in one episode, where she can be clearly seen from a top-viewed angle).</p>
