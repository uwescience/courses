<p>The present parishes of Hove and <a href="../../../../articles/p/r/e/Preston_Village%2C_Brighton_5510.html" title="Preston Village, Brighton">Preston</a> had been united as a single <a href="../../../../articles/b/e/n/Benefice.html" title="Benefice">benefice</a>, <i>Hove-cum-Preston</i>, since 1531.<sup id="cite_ref-Dale71_0-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Dale71-0" title="">[1]</a></sup> <a href="../../../../articles/s/t/_/St_Andrew%27s_Church%2C_Hove_c7ef.html" title="St Andrew's Church, Hove">St Andrew's Church</a>, of Saxon origin but rebuilt from a near-derelict state in 1836 in response to the area's growing population,<sup id="cite_ref-Dale72_1-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Dale72-1" title="">[2]</a></sup> had served as Hove-cum-Preston's parish church. When the parish was separated into two new areas serving Hove and Preston respectively in 1879,<sup id="cite_ref-Dale156_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Dale156-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> St Andrew's status was changed to that of parish church of Hove. However, when Revd Thomas Peacey was appointed the first vicar of Hove in the same year, he immediately showed his intention of replacing it with a new, more impressive church by selecting the prominent ecclesiastical <a href="../../../../articles/a/r/c/Architect.html" title="Architect">architect</a> <a href="../../../../articles/j/o/h/John_Loughborough_Pearson_4ddd.html" title="John Loughborough Pearson">John Loughborough Pearson</a> to submit a design.<sup id="cite_ref-Dale157_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Dale157-3" title="">[4]</a></sup></p>

The church was built, opened and consecrated in stages: the <a href="../../../../articles/n/a/v/Nave.html" title="Nave">nave</a> and side aisles, forming the core of the present building and costing £14,000, were opened in 1891 after a consecration ceremony by the <a href="../../../../articles/b/i/s/Bishop_of_Chichester_8d14.html" title="Bishop of Chichester">Bishop of Chichester</a> on <a href="../../../../articles/m/a/y/May_1.html" title="May 1">1 May</a> <a href="../../../../articles/1/8/9/1891.html" title="1891">1891</a>; the eastern end was not finished until 1901, four years after Pearson's death — its completion was overseen by his son, and the new Bishop of Chichester, <a href="../../../../articles/e/r/n/Ernest_Roland_Wilberforce_c280.html" title="Ernest Roland Wilberforce">Ernest Roland Wilberforce</a> consecrated it on <a href="../../../../articles/n/o/v/November_1.html" title="November 1">1 November</a> <a href="../../../../articles/1/9/0/1901.html" title="1901">1901</a>; and an incomplete tower on the southwestern side, and an adjacent <a href="../../../../articles/n/a/r/Narthex.html" title="Narthex">narthex</a>, were provided in 1924.

<p>All Saints is an imposing church — one of the largest of the 19th century Gothic revival — and bears some resemblance to one of John Loughborough Pearson's largest ecclesiastical projects, <a href="../../../../articles/t/r/u/Truro_Cathedral_43e7.html" title="Truro Cathedral">Truro Cathedral</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-acny_6-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-acny-6" title="">[7]</a></sup> Pearson used local <a href="../../../../articles/s/a/n/Sandstone.html" title="Sandstone">sandstone</a> for the exterior, in contrast to the <a href="../../../../articles/f/l/i/Flintknapping.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Flintknapping">knapped flintwork</a> and red brick decoration of his other Hove church, St Barnabas;<sup id="cite_ref-Dale154_7-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Dale154-7" title="">[8]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Dale157_3-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Dale157-3" title="">[4]</a></sup> and the predominant architectural style, the Early English Decorated style, is also markedly different from his other major churches, mostly in the London area. The interior is also of stone, usually only seen in the grandest of mediaeval buildings, and the great roof is constructed of Sussex oak. The narthex at the western end leads through to a very wide nave with aisles and tall arcades on both sides and a <a href="../../../../articles/c/h/a/Chancel.html" title="Chancel">chancel</a> with <a href="../../../../articles/c/h/a/Chapel.html#Modern_usage" title="Chapel">side chapels</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Dale157_3-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Dale157-3" title="">[4]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Dale158_8-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Dale158-8" title="">[9]</a></sup> One of these is separated from the body of the church by a canopied screen carved in wood, dedicated to people from the parish killed in the <a href="../../../../articles/f/i/r/First_World_War_31c9.html" class="mw-redirect" title="First World War">First World War</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-Dale158_8-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Dale158-8" title="">[9]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Dale159_9-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Dale159-9" title="">[10]</a></sup> The church is dominated by a stone <a href="../../../../articles/r/e/r/Reredos.html" title="Reredos">reredos</a> carved by Nathaniel Hitch and installed in 1908. Pearson used a clever conceit in the design of the church to produce a visual concentration on the reredos, which was described by the architect <a href="../../../../articles/g/o/o/Goodhart-Rendel_b500.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Goodhart-Rendel">Goodhart-Rendel</a> "as nearly perfect as can be". <a href="../../../../articles/n/i/k/Nikolaus_Pevsner_5edf.html" title="Nikolaus Pevsner">Nikolaus Pevsner</a> described the building as "superb and cathedral-like".

<p>The last vicar of the united parish of Hove-cum-Preston, Revd Walter Kelly, had built a <a href="../../../../articles/v/i/c/Vicarage.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Vicarage">vicarage</a> for the parish, but after the split it lay within the boundaries of Preston parish. Revd Peacey acted quickly to get Hove its own vicarage, obtaining land from the estate of the Stanford family upon which both a vicarage and a church could be built. The Stanfords had acquired large areas of land around Preston and Hove in the 18th century, after Preston Manor had come into the family, but by the late 19th century much of it was being developed for residential use.<sup id="cite_ref-Dale156_2-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Dale156-2" title="">[3]</a></sup> A plot of land in the area then known as "West Brighton", on the corner of the roads which became Eaton Road and The Drive, was secured, and John Loughborough Pearson was asked to design and build a vicarage that would complement the church although its design predated that of the church as built by several years.<sup id="cite_ref-Dale156_2-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Dale156-2" title="">[3]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Dale157_3-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Dale157-3" title="">[4]</a></sup> The red-brick building, constructed in 1883, has elements of the <a href="../../../../articles/r/e/n/Renaissance_architecture.html" title="Renaissance architecture">Renaissance</a> style of 400 years previously and is listed at Grade II*.<sup id="cite_ref-Dale156_2-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Dale156-2" title="">[3]</a></sup></p>
