<p>Cooper, born in <a href="../../../../articles/d/o/r/Dorset.html" title="Dorset">Dorset</a>, suffered the death of both his parents at a young age. He was the eldest son and successor of Sir John Cooper, 1st Baronet, of Rockbourne in Hampshire, and his mother was the former Anne Ashley, daughter and sole heiress of Sir Anthony Ashley, 1st Baronet (d. <a href="../../../../articles/1/6/2/1628.html" title="1628">1628</a>), of <a href="../../../../articles/w/i/m/Wimborne_St_Giles_b389.html" title="Wimborne St Giles">Wimborne St Giles</a> in <a href="../../../../articles/d/o/r/Dorset.html" title="Dorset">Dorset</a>, Secretary-at-War in the reign of <a href="../../../../articles/e/l/i/Elizabeth_I_of_England_2ce6.html" title="Elizabeth I of England">Queen Elizabeth I</a>. He was raised by relatives and family friends, while being subjected to financial mulcting through the <a href="../../../../articles/c/o/u/Court_of_Wards_f176.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Court of Wards">Court of Wards</a>. He inherited his father's Baronetcy in 1631. Educated largely by <a href="../../../../articles/p/u/r/Puritan.html" title="Puritan">Puritan</a> tutors, he attended <a href="../../../../articles/e/x/e/Exeter_College%2C_Oxford_4e14.html" title="Exeter College, Oxford">Exeter College</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/u/n/i/University_of_Oxford_2ca4.html" title="University of Oxford">Oxford</a>.

<p>Sir Anthony was elected to the <a href="../../../../articles/s/h/o/Short_Parliament_e7ef.html" title="Short Parliament">Short Parliament</a> for the borough of <a href="../../../../articles/t/e/w/Tewkesbury.html" title="Tewkesbury">Tewkesbury</a> in <a href="../../../../articles/g/l/o/Gloucestershire.html" title="Gloucestershire">Gloucestershire</a>, where his family owned land. He was elected to the <a href="../../../../articles/l/o/n/Long_Parliament_c902.html" title="Long Parliament">Long Parliament</a> for <a href="../../../../articles/p/o/o/Poole.html" title="Poole">Poole</a> in his native Dorset. But <a href="../../../../articles/d/e/n/Denzil_Holles%2C_1st_Baron_Holles_533b.html" title="Denzil Holles, 1st Baron Holles">Denzil Holles</a>, soon to rise to prominence as a leader of the opposition to the King and a personal rival of Sir Anthony, blocked his admission to the Parliament. It was probably feared that Sir Anthony, as a result of his recent marriage to the daughter of <a href="../../../../articles/c/h/a/Charles_I_of_England_350c.html" title="Charles I of England">Charles I</a>'s <a href="../../../../articles/l/o/r/Lord_Keeper_3f18.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Lord Keeper">Lord Keeper</a>, <a href="../../../../articles/t/h/o/Thomas_Coventry_8ece.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Thomas Coventry">Coventry</a>, would be too sympathetic to the king.</p>
<p>When the <a href="../../../../articles/e/n/g/English_Civil_War_6bfe.html" title="English Civil War">Civil War</a> began, Sir Anthony supported the King (somewhat echoing Holles's concerns), but changed sides soon afterward, citing the King's policies as being "destructive to religion and State". He eventually joined <a href="../../../../articles/o/l/i/Oliver_Cromwell_331c.html" title="Oliver Cromwell">Cromwell's</a> <a href="../../../../articles/c/o/u/Council_of_State_%28England%29_bdb0.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Council of State (England)">Council of State</a>, but resigned in <a href="../../../../articles/1/6/5/1655.html" title="1655">1655</a>, protesting against Cromwell's dictatorial politics. Four years later, <a href="../../../../articles/g/e/o/George_Monck%2C_1st_Duke_of_Albemarle_9c28.html" title="George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle">George Monck</a>, a prominent royalist military officer, recruited Cooper in the <a href="../../../../articles/e/n/g/English_Restoration_df9a.html" title="English Restoration">Restoration</a> of <a href="../../../../articles/c/h/a/Charles_II_of_England_f8dd.html" title="Charles II of England">Charles II</a>.</p>

<p>In October <a href="../../../../articles/1/6/6/1660.html" title="1660">1660</a>, shortly after the Restoration's success, Sir Anthony was on the commission that controversially tried the <a href="../../../../articles/r/e/g/Regicides.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Regicides">Regicides</a> (those who had participated in the trial and execution of Charles I). The commission eventually found ten surviving members guilty, and another four were posthumously convicted (their bodies were exhumed and hanged publicly). One year later, he was created <b>Baron Ashley</b>, of Wimborne St Giles in the County of Dorset, and appointed <a href="../../../../articles/c/h/a/Chancellor_of_the_Exchequer_78e8.html" title="Chancellor of the Exchequer">Chancellor of the Exchequer</a>.</p>

A rough picture of a young Shaftesbury, when he was known as Lord Ashley.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In that position, Lord Ashley served on the <a href="../../../../articles/c/l/a/Clarendon_Ministry_e00f.html" title="Clarendon Ministry">Clarendon Ministry</a> as one of its less prominent members; he frequently quarrelled with the head of government, <a href="../../../../articles/e/d/w/Edward_Hyde%2C_1st_Earl_of_Clarendon_4ab9.html" title="Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon">Lord Clarendon</a>, especially upon matters of religious toleration (which Ashley supported but Clarendon opposed). In 1663, Ashley was one of eight Lords Proprietors given title to a huge tract of land in <a href="../../../../articles/n/o/r/North_America_e7c4.html" title="North America">North America</a>, which eventually became the <a href="../../../../articles/p/r/o/Province_of_Carolina_dd3d.html" title="Province of Carolina">Province of Carolina</a>. Ashley probably collaborated with John Locke to write the <a href="../../../../articles/f/u/n/Fundamental_Constitutions_of_Carolina_daf3.html" title="Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina">Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina</a>. Both the <a href="../../../../articles/a/s/h/Ashley_River_%28South_Carolina%29_b758.html" title="Ashley River (South Carolina)">Ashley River</a> and the <a href="../../../../articles/c/o/o/Cooper_River_%28South_Carolina%29_9c4a.html" title="Cooper River (South Carolina)">Cooper River</a> in South Carolina were named after Lord Ashley.</p>
<p>In 1666, he met <a href="../../../../articles/j/o/h/John_Locke_68b4.html" title="John Locke">John Locke</a>. Cooper had come to Oxford seeking treatment for a liver infection. Cooper was impressed with Locke and persuaded him to become part of his retinue. Locke had been looking for a career and in 1667 moved into Shaftesbury's home at Exeter House in London, ostensibly as the household physician. Shaftesbury's liver infection became life-threatening. Locke coordinated the advice of several physicians and was probably instrumental in persuading Shaftesbury to undergo an operation (then life-threatening itself) to remove the cyst. Shaftesbury survived and prospered, crediting Locke with saving his life.</p>
<p>After the fall of Lord Clarendon in <a href="../../../../articles/1/6/6/1667.html" title="1667">1667</a>, Lord Ashley became a prominent member of the <a href="../../../../articles/c/a/b/Cabal.html" title="Cabal">Cabal</a>, in which he formed the second "A". Ashley became <a href="../../../../articles/l/o/r/Lord_Chancellor_7301.html" title="Lord Chancellor">Lord Chancellor</a> in <a href="../../../../articles/1/6/7/1672.html" title="1672">1672</a>, and was created <b>Earl of Shaftesbury</b> and <b>Baron Cooper</b>, of Pawlett in the County of Somerset. He was also appointed <a href="../../../../articles/p/r/e/President_of_the_Board_of_Trade_df52.html" class="mw-redirect" title="President of the Board of Trade">First Lord of Trade</a>. He served as Chancellor for one year, but remained First Lord of Trade until <a href="../../../../articles/1/6/7/1676.html" title="1676">1676</a>.</p>
<p>Due to his intriguing with the <a href="../../../../articles/j/a/m/James_Scott%2C_1st_Duke_of_Monmouth_f2b0.html" title="James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth">Duke of Monmouth</a> against the succession of the Catholic <a href="../../../../articles/j/a/m/James_II_of_England_fb06.html" title="James II of England">Duke of York</a>, Shaftesbury fell from favour, and became a leader of the radical <a href="../../../../articles/b/r/i/British_Whig_Party_0b9e.html" class="mw-redirect" title="British Whig Party">Whigs</a>. In <a href="../../../../articles/1/6/8/1681.html" title="1681">1681</a>, Shaftesbury was charged with <a href="../../../../articles/h/i/g/High_treason_in_the_United_Kingdom_482c.html" title="High treason in the United Kingdom">high treason</a>, but the charges were later dismissed. Nonetheless, he fled to the <a href="../../../../articles/n/e/t/Netherlands.html" title="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, where he died two years later.</p>
