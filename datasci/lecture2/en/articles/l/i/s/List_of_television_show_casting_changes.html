<p>Casting changes occur on many television shows; either a character is replaced by another actor with a new character, or a new actor takes over an existing role when the original actor is dropped (sometimes in movies). Some cast changes have been significant enough to cause the show to "<a href="../../../../articles/j/u/m/Jumping_the_shark.html" title="Jumping the shark">jump the shark</a>" by detrimentally affecting the quality of the show.</p>

<p>Some of the examples below have given rise to slang phrases, used to jokingly describe similar changes in other shows. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>Chuck Cunningham Syndrome</i>, when a <a href="#Disappearing_characters" title="">character disappears</a> <i>without any further mention.<sup id="cite_ref-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-0" title="">[1]</a></sup></i></li>
<li><i>Darrin Syndrome</i>, when the actor playing a main character is replaced without comment, as with Darrin Stevens in <i><a href="../../../../articles/b/e/w/Bewitched.html" title="Bewitched">Bewitched</a></i>. <sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1" title="">[2]</a></sup></li>
<li><i>Character Bounce</i>, when a character leaves (or disappears) only to return later. Beverly Crusher in <i><a href="../../../../articles/t/h/e/Star_Trek%7E_The_Next_Generation_3745.html" title="Star Trek: The Next Generation">Star Trek: The Next Generation</a></i> (who was missing in season 2) is an example.</li>

<p>Show casting changes listed here must have a discontinuation of the same character after the actor has left. In fictional shows, the script typically allows others characters to be aware of the absence of the character—usually as a death, which has led to the phrase "killing off a character". This sometimes also occurs when a character leaves the show (and usually the city) to appear in their own <a href="../../../../articles/s/p/i/Spin-off.html" title="Spin-off">spin-off</a>.</p>
